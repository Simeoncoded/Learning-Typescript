Anders Hejlsberg is the lead architect of typescript

Typescript is just a superset of javascript. It includes all the same stuff that javascript includes.
It just adds some fancy stuff on top of it.

The whole point of Typescript is to add static typing to javascript, 

const bootupMessage : string = "";(the string annotation on the bootupMessage variable? Thats telling typescript ,hey the thing 
that follows is a string)

Javascript is dynamic and loosely typed, 

//javascript: 
function add(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

//typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

all javascript code is valid typescript
but all typescript code is not valid javascript 

The any type is essentially a type that can literally be anything
